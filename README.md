# Laragist Web
LaraGist is an open source project to curate the best packages and libraries for Laravel PHP Framework. This Vue.js application serves as front-end for LaraGist.org.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install the dependencies
This will install the dependencies of this starter website. It will pull in several packages like Vue, Vueify, vue-router, gulp and Laravel Elixir (this is just magic syntactical sugar for gulp, basically).

```
npm install
```

### Step 2: Run Gulp
Gulp will compile the Sass stylesheets and run browserify. All the source files are in the 'resources' folder and will publish the results to the 'public' folder.

```
gulp
```

### Step 3: Serve it
You can now serve the files using your webserver of choice. Just set your webserver directory to ```/public```
